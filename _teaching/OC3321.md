A foundation course for studies of atmospheric and oceanographic motions. The governing dynamical equations for rotating stratified fluid are derived from fundamental physical laws. Topics include the continuum hypothesis, real and apparent forces, derivations and applications of the governing equations, coordinate systems, scale analysis, simple balanced flows, boundary conditions, thermal wind, barotropic and baroclinic conditions, circulation, vorticity, and divergence.
