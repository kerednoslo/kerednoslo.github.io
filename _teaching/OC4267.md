Examines sound speed profiles (time and space variability), ambient noise, absorption, and reflection and scattering from the sea surface and bottom as they affect sound propagation in the ocean. Synoptic prediction techniques for ambient noise and transmission loss are reviewed. Environmental data input and computational approximations for acoustic models are evaluated against observed signal fluctuations and transmission loss.
