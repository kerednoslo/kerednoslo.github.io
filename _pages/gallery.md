Fun and interesting images in acoustics
=====
Here you will (future tense here, not command form) find some fun images from my research.

While you're waiting for my own images, you can checkout art by [Lindsay Olson](https://www.lindsayolsonart.com). I've been lucky to work with her on a project about sound in the ocean. She went on a cruise with [Dr. Jennifer Miksis-Olds](https://ccom.unh.edu/user/jmiksisolds) for the [ADEON project](https://adeon.unh.edu), and made [art about passive acoustics, active acoustics, and had fun at sea](https://www.lindsayolsonart.com/portfolio/soundinthesea/). Surprisingly, there are equations in the art, including my life-long friend the wave equation,

$$
\nabla^2 p +k^2p - 0
$$,

and the passive and active sonar equations respectively,

$$
SNR = SL - TL - NL
$$

$$
SNR = SL - 2TL + TS - NL
$$.

Lindsay also happens to be my mom, and it was fun working together.
