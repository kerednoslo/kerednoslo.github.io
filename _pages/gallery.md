Fun and interesting images in acoustics
=====
Here you will (future tense here) find some fun images from my research.

I've worked with artist [Lindsay Olson](https://www.lindsayolsonart.com). She went on a cruise with [Dr. Jennifer Miksis-Olds](https://ccom.unh.edu/user/jmiksisolds) for the [ADEON project](https://adeon.unh.edu), and made [art about passive acoustics, active acoustics, and had fun at sea](https://www.lindsayolsonart.com/portfolio/soundinthesea/). Surprisingly, there are equations in the art, including the wave equation, passive sonar equation, and active sonar equation. Lindsay also happens to be my mom, and it was fun working together.

I hope that someday the Helmholz-Kirchhoff integral equation,
\begin{align}
p(\mathbf{r}_p) = p_i(\mathbf{r}_p) + \int G_k(\mathbf{r}_s,\mathbf{r}_p) \frac{\partial p(\mathbf{r}_s)}{\partial n_s} - \frac{\partial G_k(\mathbf{r}_s,\mathbf{r}_p)}{\partial n_s}  p(\mathbf{r}_s) \, \textrm{d}S_s\, ,
\end{align}
becomes art, but it's probably a long shot.
