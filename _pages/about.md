I am an acoustician working on interaction between high-frequency sound and the ocean floor and volume (aka scattering). Measurements of scattering are useful for remotely sensing physical properties of the seafloor (density, sound speed roughness), physical processes in the ocean (turbulence, fronts), and biological organisms (e.g. fish and plankton). I primarily work on physical scattering models for the seafloor.
