I am an acoustician studying the interaction between high-frequency sound and the ocean floor and volume (aka scattering).

Measurements of scattering are useful for remotely sensing physical properties of the seafloor (density, sound speed roughness), physical processes in the ocean (turbulence, fronts), and biological organisms (e.g. fish and plankton). I don't get to work on all of these topics, but spend most of my time measureing the acoustic response of the seafloor, taking pictures of rocks.

I teach acoustics and oceanography at the Naval Postgraduate school, and advise students who are interested in high-frequency acoustics, and characterization of the seafloor environment.
